# ScribbleBench

**ScribbleBench** is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the generalization capabilities of 3D scribble-supervised medical image segmentation methods. It spans seven diverse datasets across multiple anatomies and modalities and provides realistic, automatically generated scribble annotations.

This repository provides:
- A guide on how to setup the ScribbleBench benchmark using the original dataset sources and our ScribbleBench scribbles.
- Our scribble generation code to create realistic interior and boundary scribbles heuristics.
- An evaluation script to evaluate your method using ScribbleBench.
- A reference to our scribble baseline nnnUNet+pL
- A scribble annotation protocol for domain experts that can be used as guidance to quickly annotate new datasets manually.

ScribbleBench was introduced in our MICCAI 2025 paper:  
**“Revisiting 3D Medical Scribble Supervision: Benchmarking Beyond Cardiac Segmentation”**  
Authors: Karol Gotkowski, Klaus H. Maier-Hein, Fabian Isensee


## 📦 Benchmark Setup

ScribbleBench includes scribbles for the following 7 public datasets:
- ACDC
- MSCMR
- WORD
- AMOS2022 (Task2)
- KiTS23
- LiTS
- BraTS2020

## 🛠️ Scribble Generation

You can use our script to generate scribbles for your own 3D medical segmentation datasets. The script supports:
- Interior scribbles using NURBS curves.
- Boundary scribbles based on partial contours.
- Foreground/background slice balancing.
- Multiprocessing for efficient processing of large datasets.

### 🚀 Run Scribble Generation

```bash
python generate_scribbles.py \
  --input path/to/dense_segmentations \
  --output path/to/save_scribbles \
  --num_labels 4 \
  --conf scribble_conf.yml \
  --processes 8
```

**Optional arguments:**

* `--name` → specify one or more file names to process (omit `.nii.gz`)
* `--disable_ignore` → disables marking unlabeled voxels with an ignore label

## 📊 Evaluation

You can evaluate your segmentation predictions using the provided script:

```bash
python evaluation.py \
  --gt_dir path/to/ground_truth \
  --pred_dir path/to/predictions \
  --num_labels 4 \
  --processes 8
```

## 🧠 Scribble Baseline nnUNet+pL

Our scribble baseline nnUNet+pL is implemented in the [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework itself. It is there referred to as "ignore label" and is described [here](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/ignore_label.md).

## 📋 Scribble Annotation Protocol

You can also manually create your own scribbles for new datasets by following this lightweight annotation protocol. These human-created scribbles can be used directly to train a model using the same methods as with automatically generated ones.

### ✏️ Instructions

Given a 3D image **I** in your dataset:
- For each axial slice **S** in **I**:
  - For each class **C** present in slice **S**:
    - Select a single **connected component (CC)** of class **C** in **S**
    - For that component **CC**, draw:
      - One **interior scribble**
      - One **boundary scribble**

Note: Do not ignore the background class! Also include a good number of pure background slices.

#### 🟢 Interior Scribble
- Must be drawn **inside the component CC**.
- Should be placed roughly **in and around the center area** of the component.
- Ideal length is **comparable to the diameter or extent** of the component.
- Can be any arbitrary shape (straight, curved, etc.) as long as it lies **fully within the component**.

#### 🔵 Boundary Scribble
- Should trace **a portion (15%–100%)** of the **inner boundary** of the component CC.
- Should ideally follow the actual boundary as closely as possible.
- A **1–3 voxel inward offset** is acceptable, but **closer to the true boundary is better**.
- This scribble helps the model capture **boundary details** during learning.

Following this protocol allows quick and efficient labeling of 3D datasets using just a few sparse lines per class and slice, while maintaining strong training performance.
